# Callbahx

Use Haxe remoting to communicate from Flash-land to JS-land. But with callbacks!

# Acknowledgements

HUGE portions of this code were lifted, with permission, from [dionjwa/haxe_remoting](https://github.com/dionjwa/haxe_remoting). Thank-you dionjwa for the great start!

In particular, `ExternalAsyncConnection`, `Macros`, and `RemotingUtility` were lifted and tweaked.

# Try it Out

There is a sample provided. First, note that you'll need to add the path (or parent, or grandparent, or great-grandparent, etc.) to the Flash Developer Tools > Trusted Location Settings... Then run `haxe sample.hxml` in the project directory. You'll want to have Developer Tools open in your browser to see the debug console output from the JS side of the world.

You can take a look at the code in the `/sample` directory to see what it is doing.
